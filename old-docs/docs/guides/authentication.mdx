# Authentication

Most of the application we had the chance to work on required some sort of authentication. and having a bad approach to do it can lead to a lot of problems. The starter comes with a basic and mostly what you need to start with authentication in your application.

As Authentication is global to the application, we end up using zustand to manage the authentication state of the application.

[Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand) is a state management library that is very simple to use and very performant. It is also very easy to use with React and work better than a simple context API as it comes with a sort of features such us selectors to prevent unnecessary re-renders.

Zustand also work very well with TypeScript and and can be easily used outside React three. which means more flexibility.

## Authentication Store

As we said before, we use zustand to manage the authentication state of the application. The authentication store is located in `src/store/auth` and is used to manage the authentication state of the application.

<CodeBlock title="src/core/auth/index.ts" language="tsx">
  {AuthStore}
</CodeBlock>

The store is composed of 2 state and 3 actions:

- `status`: The status of the authentication. It can be `idle`, `signOut`or `signIn`.

  - `idle`: Still not sure if the user is authenticated or not (when we are fetching token from the storage)
  - `signOut`: The user is not authenticated
  - `signIn`: The user is authenticated

- `useToken`: The token of the user. It is used to authenticate the user to the API. It is stored in the storage of the device and we used it to hydrate the authentication status state when the application is started.

  For the Demo app `useToken` is a simple object that contains the `accessToken` and the `refreshToken`. You can add more fields if you update the `TokenType` type in `src/core/auth/utils.ts`.

- `signIn`: The action to sign in the user. It takes the token as a parameter and set the token state and store it locally as well as setting the status to `signIn`.

- `signOut`: The action to sign out the user. It set the token state to `null` and remove it from the storage as well as setting the status to `signOut`.

- `hydrate`: The action to hydrate the authentication status state. we call this action when the application is started to check if the user is authenticated or not. It fetch the token from the storage and set the status to `signIn` if the token is not `null` or `signOut` if the token is `null`.

## Use Authentication store

You guessed it, you only need to import the store from `@/core` and use it in your component or even call store actions from outside React.

```tsx
import { useAuth, hydrate } from '@/core';

hydrate(); // call this when the application is started to check if the user is authenticated or not

const App = () => {
  const status = useAuth.use.status();
  const signOut = useAuth.use.signOut();

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>{status}</Text>
      <Button title="Sign Out" onPress={signOut} />
    </View>
  );
};
```

## Use Case

Lets imagine we have a simple application that has a login navigator and home navigator. The home navigator is only accessible if the user is authenticated. The login navigator is accessible if the user is not authenticated.

In this case you only need to get the status from the authentication store and render the right navigation according to the status.

<CodeBlock title="src/navigation/root-navigator.tsx" language="tsx">
  {RootNavigator}
</CodeBlock>
