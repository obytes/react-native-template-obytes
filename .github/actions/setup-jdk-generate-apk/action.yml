# ‚úçÔ∏è Description:
# This is a composite action, which means it can be used in other actions.
# This action is used to set up the JDK environment and generate an Android APK for testing.
# This action accepts one input: `APP_ENV`, which is used to generate an APK for a specific environment (development, staging, production). We use staging by default.
# Before generating the APK, we run a pre-build script to generate the necessary native folders based on the APP_ENV.
# On success, the APK is generated at `./android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk`.

# üëÄ Example usage:
#       - name : üì¶ Set Up JDK + Generate Test APK
#         uses: ./.github/actions/setup-jdk-generate-apk
#         with:
#           APP_ENV: 'staging'
