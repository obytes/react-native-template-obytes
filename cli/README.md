# Overview

As a team of experienced developers at Obytes Mobile Tribe, we have spent years refining our approach to building high-quality React Native applications. Our starter kit is based on the best practices and tools that we have found to be most effective in our own projects.

This starter kit has been thoroughly tested and proven successful in multiple projects over the past four years. It is regularly used by our team on a daily basis and has helped us deliver great results for our clients.

While our starter kit is heavily influenced by our own opinions and experiences, we have carefully selected the included solutions to address common challenges and meet the needs of the majority of use cases. We believe it offers a streamlined and efficient approach to building React Native apps, and we are confident that it can help others achieve their project goals as well.

## 🚀 Motivation

Our goal with this starter kit was to streamline the process of building React Native apps, both for our own team and for our clients. We wanted to create a resource that would allow us to create high-quality apps faster and with less effort, while ensuring that all of our projects adhere to the same code standards and architectural principles.

The benefits of using this starter kit are numerous. It helps our team easily switch between projects, as we can rely on a consistent foundation of code. It also allows us to focus on the business logic of each project rather than getting bogged down in boilerplate code. And, because it promotes consistency across projects, it makes it easier to maintain and scale our apps, as well as share code between teams.

Overall, our starter kit is designed to facilitate efficient and effective app development, helping us to bring the best possible products to our clients

## ✍️ Philosophy

When creating this starter kit, we had several guiding principles in mind::

- **🚀 Production-ready**: We wanted to ensure that this starter was ready for real-world use, providing a solid foundation for building production-grade apps.

- **🧩 Minimal code and dependencies**: We aimed to keep the codebase and dependencies as small as possible.
- **💪 Well-maintained third-party libraries**: We included only well-maintained and reliable third-party libraries, to provide stability and support for our projects.

## 😉 Why Expo?

Expo is a powerful tool for building React Native apps, offering a range of features and benefits that can help developers create high-quality apps more efficiently. One question we often receive from the community is why we choose to use Expo instead of the React Native CLI.

In the past, our team used the React Native CLI for our starter kit. However, we found that using Expo presented several advantages. In particular, the introduction of the Custom dev client feature allowed us to take advantage of the Expo ecosystem and utilize native libraries without the need for ejecting the app. This has greatly simplified our development process and enabled us to focus on the business logic of our projects.

Additionally, we have found that using Expo has made it easier to upgrade our apps to new versions, eliminating the issues we previously encountered when using the React Native CLI.

Overall, we believe that Expo offers numerous benefits for building React Native apps and is a valuable tool for any developer. The real question may be, **why not use Expo?**
