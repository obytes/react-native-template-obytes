[react-navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/) is the most popular navigation library for React Native. It is easy to use and provides a lot of features out of the box. It is also very customizable and extensible. It is a great choice for most apps now a day waiting for expo router to be stable and ready for production ðŸ˜€ (looks promising ðŸ”¥).

Probably nothing we can add here that doesn't exist in the official docs except that we are using native stack navigation instead of the default one.

All the navigation related code is located in the `src/navigation` folder. we opted for this approach to keep the project structure clean and easy to navigate.

One last think to mention is that we added a global declaration for `ReactNavigation` namespace to add Typescript support to `navigate` function from `useNavigation` hook.

<CodeBlock file="src/navigation/types.tsx" />

One ever you add a new stack navigator you need to add it to the `RootStackParamList` type as mentioned in the snippet above.

The Demo app comes with different stack and tabs navigator. feel free to remove what is not working for you and add your own using the same approach as the existing ones and remember to add the the typing to the `RootStackParamList` type.

Here is a simple example of the feed stack navigator.

<CodeBlock file="src/navigation/feed-navigator.tsx" />

Make sure to check the official docs for more information and examples about [react-navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/).
