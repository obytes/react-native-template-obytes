# Storage

The starter comes with a simple storage module that uses [react-native-mmkv](https://github.com/mrousavy/react-native-mmkv) to store data in a key-value format. We also added a simple storage utility to assist you in using the storage module.

<CodeBlock file="src/core/storage.tsx" />

The `react-native-mmkv` library provides various features such as using hooks and adding encryption to stored data. Feel free to check the [official docs](https://github.com/mrousavy/react-native-mmkv) for more information.
