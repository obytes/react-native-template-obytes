Welcome to the Obytes Mobile Tribe's Expo / React Native Starter Kit!

## üöÄ Motivation

Our goal with this starter kit was to streamline the process of building React Native apps, both for our own team and for our clients. We wanted to create a resource that would allow us to create high-quality apps faster and with less effort, while ensuring that all of our projects adhere to the same code standards and architectural principles.

The benefits of using this starter kit are numerous. It helps our team easily switch between projects, as we can rely on a consistent foundation of code. It also allows us to focus on the business logic of each project rather than getting bogged down in boilerplate code. And, because it promotes consistency across projects, it makes it easier to maintain and scale our apps, as well as share code between teams.

Overall, our starter kit is designed to facilitate efficient and effective app development, helping us to bring the best possible products to our clients

## ‚úçÔ∏è Philosophy

When creating this starter kit, we had several guiding principles in mind::

- **üöÄ Production-ready**: We wanted to ensure that this starter was ready for real-world use, providing a solid foundation for building production-grade apps.
- **ü•∑ Developer experience and productivity**: Our focus was on creating a starter that would enhance the developer experience and increase productivity.
- **üß© Minimal code and dependencies**: We aimed to keep the codebase and dependencies as small as possible.
- **üí™ Well-maintained third-party libraries**: We included only well-maintained and reliable third-party libraries, to provide stability and support for our projects.

## ‚≠ê Key Features

## ü§î Is this starter for me?

Yes üòÄ

This starter kit is designed to benefit a wide range of React Native developers, from beginners to experienced professionals. Here's why it might be a good fit for you:

1. **For beginners:** It provides a solid foundation with best practices and common solutions, helping you learn industry-standard approaches to React Native development.

2. **For experienced developers:** It offers a well-structured, production-ready setup that can save you time and effort in project initialization and configuration.

3. **For teams:** It ensures consistency across projects and team members, making it easier to onboard new developers and maintain code quality.

4. **For explorers:** Even if you prefer not to use starter kits, this project can serve as a valuable reference. You can explore the codebase, documentation, and architectural decisions to gain insights and potentially adopt specific solutions for your own projects.

5. **For learners:** The starter kit incorporates up-to-date libraries and patterns, offering an opportunity to familiarize yourself with current best practices in the React Native ecosystem.

6. **For AI-assisted development:** This starter kit works well with AI coding tools. It provides a solid structure and best practices that can guide AI-generated code. This helps ensure that AI assistance leads to high-quality, maintainable code that fits well within your project.

Remember, you don't have to use the entire starter kit as-is. Feel free to cherry-pick ideas, configurations, or code snippets that align with your project needs. Whether you're building a new app from scratch or looking to improve your existing development process, this starter kit can provide valuable insights and practical solutions.

## üòâ Why Expo and not React Native CLI?

We have been using Expo as our main framework since the introduction of [Continuous Native Generation (CNG)](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/continuous-native-generation/) concept and we are happy with the experience.

I think this question is not valid anymore specially after the last React conference when the core react native team recommended using Expo for new projects.

> "As of today, the only recommended community framework for React Native is Expo. Folks at Expo have been investing in the React Native ecosystem since the early days of React Native and as of today, we believe the developer experience offered by Expo is best in class." React native core team
