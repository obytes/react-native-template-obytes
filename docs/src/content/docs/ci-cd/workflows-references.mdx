The starter comes with over 10 GitHub Actions workflows that help you automate the process of checking, testing, releasing, and much more.

All those workflows are self-documented and contain all details directly inside the workflow file as comments. This approach makes it easier to understand what each workflow does and how to use it without having to go back and forth between the documentation and the workflow file.

This page lists all workflows and actions we use and adds more details on the approach we are using to make those workflows as simple as possible.

All files related to GitHub Actions are located in the `.github/workflows` and `.github/actions` folders.

## Actions

You can think of actions as functions that are used by workflows to perform a specific task and allow you to reuse the same task in multiple workflows without duplicating the code which made them easier to maintain.

All actions are located in the `.github/actions` folder, and here is the complete list:
