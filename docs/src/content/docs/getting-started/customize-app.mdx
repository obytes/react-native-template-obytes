The starter is a simple expo app. You just need to edit `app.config.ts` file to update expo attributes and configuration.

Here is the complete config file :

<Code file='app.config.ts' />

You can read more about expo configuration [here](https://docs.expo.io/workflow/configuration/).
If you have any configuration that depend on environment variables such us API urls or keys, you can create it in `config` file following [environment variables guide](./environment-vars-config) and import you config to `app.config.ts` file.

## Splash screen and app icon

As we are using expo to create the starter, updating the app icon and splash screen is very easy and straight forward. You only need to update the app icon and splash screen images inside the `assets` folder and run `expo prebuild` to update the app icon and splash screen.

As we are supporting multiple variant for development, staging and production environment you need 3 different icons but the right solution is to use the same icon with badges for each environment.

For more details about the app icon and splash screen, please refer to the expo documentation.
