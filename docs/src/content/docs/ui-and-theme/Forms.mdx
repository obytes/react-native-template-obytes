Forms are a common feature of any application. In this section, we will show you how you can handle form the right way with the starter.

## react-hook-form

The starter uses [react-hook-form](https://react-hook-form.com/) to handle forms. It is a popular library that provides a lot of features out of the box. It is also very easy to use and integrate with React Native.

Make sure check the [react-hook-form documentation](https://react-hook-form.com/) to learn more about how to use it.

As we mention in the components section of the documentation [here](./components), we create a set of controlled components that are only used with react-hook-form. The starter only provide two components: `ControlledInput` and `ControlledSelect` but you can easily create other components using the same approach.

Here is the complete code of our `ControlledInput` when we use `useController` hook from react-hook-form to handle form state and validation rules:

<CodeBlock  file="src/ui/core/input/controlled-input.tsx" />

If you want to create your own controlled component, you just need to make sure your component props type extends from `InputControllerType` the same way we are using it with `ControlledInput`.
Here is an other example of a Select input we create using the same approach as `ControlledInput`:

<CodeBlock  file="src/ui/core/select/controlled-select.tsx" />

## Use Case

Lets say you want to create a form that allows the user login to the application. You will need to create a screen that will contain the form with email and password as well as a button to submit the form. The form will need to be validated and the data will need to be sent to the backend. here is who you can do it:

**Step 1: Create your schema validation **

The right way to validate a form is to create a schema validation. You can use any library you want but we recommend using zod as you can easily infer the types from the schema. Here is how you can create a schema validation for the login form:

```tsx
import * as z from 'zod';

const schema = z.object({
  email: z.string().email(),
  password: z.string().min(6),
});

type FormType = z.infer<typeof schema>;
```

**Step 2: Create your form component**

Now that you have your schema validation, you can easily create your login screen using react-hook-form and controlled components we already have.
Here is how you can create your login screen:

```tsx
import { zodResolver } from '@hookform/resolvers/zod';
import React from 'react';
import { useForm } from 'react-hook-form';
import * as z from 'zod';

import { useAuth } from '@/core';
import { Button, ControlledInput, View } from '@/ui';

const schema = z.object({
  email: z.string().email(),
  password: z.string().min(6),
});

type FormType = z.infer<typeof schema>;

export const Login = () => {
  const { signIn } = useAuth();

  const { handleSubmit, control } = useForm<FormType>({
    resolver: zodResolver(schema),
  });

  const onSubmit = (data: FormType) => {
    console.log(data);
    signIn({ access: 'access-token', refresh: 'refresh-token' });
  };
  return (
    <View className="flex-1 justify-center p-4">
      <ControlledInput control={control} name="email" label="Email" />
      <ControlledInput
        control={control}
        name="password"
        label="Password"
        placeholder="***"
        secureTextEntry={true}
      />
      <Button
        label="Login"
        onPress={handleSubmit(onSubmit)}
        variant="primary"
      />
    </View>
  );
};
```

Done ! You have created a form with validation and typescript support.

:::tip
Any Component with props that inherit from the `InputControllerType` can be used with react-hook-form. You can easily create your own controlled component using the same approach as `ControlledInput` and `ControlledSelect`.

## Handling Keyboard

The template comes with [`react-native-avoid-softinput`](https://mateusz1913.github.io/react-native-avoid-softinput/) pre-installed and configured to handle the keyboard. You only need to use the `useSoftKeyboardEffect` hook on your screen, and you're good to go.

```tsx

import React from 'react';
import { useSoftKeyboardEffect } from '@/core/keyboard';
import { LoginForm } from './login-form';

export const Login = () => {
  useSoftKeyboardEffect();
  return <LoginForm  />;
};

```




:::tip
Note that the hook is not an all-in-one solution for all cases, and you might need more customization depending on your use case. So, please refer to the documentation [recipes pages](https://mateusz1913.github.io/react-native-avoid-softinput/docs/recipes/recipes-form) for more information.
