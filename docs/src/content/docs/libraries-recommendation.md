The starter kit comes with a set of pre-installed and configured libraries. We recommend using these libraries for your project.

Below, we'll list other libraries we often use in our projects. These aren't included in the starter because:

1. They're for specific use cases.
2. They need a lot of setup.

This way, you can add them to your project only if you need them, keeping things simple to start with.

### State Management:

The starter kit comes with Zustand out of the box but if your application implements a lot of workflows, you might want to use [XState](https://xstate.js.org/) as it's more powerful on managing complex workflows and state machines.

For example, if you have a workflow to create a new card for user and this workflow has a lot of steps and conditions, Zustand might not be the best choice as it's more designed for simple state management and XState is your best choice in this case.

### Error Reporting:

- [Sentry](https://sentry.io/welcome/): very popular solution for error reporting in the javascript ecosystem and has a great integration with Expo.

### Notifications:

There is no solution fit all for notifications, but based on your use case we would recommend one of the following:

- [Expo Push Notifications](https://docs.expo.dev/push-notifications/overview/)
- [OneSignal](https://onesignal.com/)

### Analytics:

- [PostHog](https://posthog.com/docs/libraries/react-native) : Easy to setup and use and has a great free tier.

- [Google Analytics](https://rnfirebase.io/analytics/usage)

### Charts:

- [Victory Native](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/victory-native-xl)
