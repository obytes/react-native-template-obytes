Writing end-to-end tests is one of the best ways to ensure that your app is working as expected and simulate exactly how a user would interact with it. However, running those tests can be challenging and time-consuming due to their nature and the need to run them on a device or emulator.

The good news is that we have included [Maestro](https://www.mobile.dev/) the easiest way to run end-to-end tests yet very powerful and come up with a lot of features that will make your life easier.

One of Maestro's best features is its user-friendly test writing capability. It's incredibly simple to write tests using the app, making it accessible to PMs, QAs, and even designers.

Watch this talk by the amazing Henry Moulton for more details about Maestro and how it can help you write better tests: [Henry Moulton â€“ React Native end-to-end testing with Maestro | App.js Conf 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoCzBdFCoqc)

## Installing Maestro

To install Maestro, run the following :

```bash
# a simple npm script that runs the following command:  curl -Ls 'https://get.maestro.mobile.dev' | bash
pnpm install-maestro
```

## Writing tests

Go to the `maestro` directory and write your tests.
Here is a quick test we wrote for log in screen using Maestro:

<CodeBlock file=".maestro/auth/login-with-validation.yaml" />

To run the tests, execute the following command:

```bash
pnpm e2e-test
```

This will run the tests on the local emulator and here is a recording of the test from maestro dashboard:

## Running tests on CI

Running tests on CI is very important to ensure that your code doesn't break when you push it to GitHub. However, running end-to-end tests is quite expensive and time-consuming. To test your app on CI, we need to first build the app, set up the emulator, and then run the tests. This process can consume a significant amount of time and resources.

For this reason, we do not recommend running end-to-end tests on every pull request pushed to GitHub. Instead, we recommend running them for pull requests that contain `test-android` labels so that we can trigger the tests manually by adding the correct label whenever you feel the PR is ready to be tested.

The starter comes with a bunch of GitHub actions that will help you run the tests on CI.

> for now we only support running tests on Android, we are working on adding support for iOS.

- `e2e-android.yml` - Triggered when a PR is labeled with `android-test-github` or run manually from the actions tab in GitHub.
  This action will generate a staging build for the app, set up the emulator, and run the tests using Maestro.

- `e2e-android-maestro.yml` - Triggered when a PR is labeled with `android-test-maestro-cloud` or run manually from the actions tab in GitHub.
  This action will run the tests using Maestro Cloud. You will need to add your Maestro Cloud token to the secrets in GitHub.

- `e2e-android-eas-build.yml` - Accepts a EAS APK URL and runs the tests. This action is triggered manually from the actions tab in GitHub.
