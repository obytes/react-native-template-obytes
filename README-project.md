### SonarQube setup

SonarQube is an open-source platform for continuous inspection of code quality. It performs automatic reviews to detect bugs, code smells, and security vulnerabilities. Rootstrap has a SonarQube instance to improve the quality of the software we develop. On each PR, a GitHub Action is triggered to perform the analysis. To set up SonarQube correctly, you need to add the `SONAR_TOKEN`, `SONAR_URL`, and `SONAR_PROJECT` secrets to the repository. Additionally, you must select the quality gate named `ReactNativeTemplate` for your project on SonarQube. In case you're using this project outside Rootstrap and you're not planning to use SonarQube the sonar scanner [workflow](.github/workflows/sonar.yml) should be deleted.
